        "title": "Assessing the impact of a major electronic music festival on the consumption patterns of illicit and licit psychoactive substances in a Mediterranean city using wastewater analysis.",
        "abstract": "The consumption patterns of five categories of psychoactive substances (PS), including \"conventional\" illicit drugs, new psychoactive substances (NPS), therapeutic opioids, alcohol and nicotine, were studied in the city of Split, Croatia, using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), with an emphasis on the impact of a large electronic music festival. The study involved the analysis of 57 urinary biomarkers of PS in raw municipal wastewater samples collected in three characteristic periods, including the festival week in the peak-tourist season (July) and reference weeks in the peak-tourist season (August) and the off-tourist season (November). Such a large number of biomarkers allowed the recognition of distinct patterns of PS use associated with the festival, but also revealed some subtle differences between summer and autumn seasons. The festival week was characterized by markedly increased use of illicit stimulants (MDMA: 30-fold increase; cocaine and amphetamine: 1.7-fold increase) and alcohol (1.7-fold increase), while consumption of other common illicit drugs (cannabis and heroin), major therapeutic opioids (morphine, codeine and tramadol) and nicotine remained rather constant. Interestingly, NPS and methamphetamine clearly contributed to the festival PS signature in wastewater, but their prevalence was rather low compared to that of common illicit drugs. Estimates of cocaine and cannabis use were largely consistent with prevalence data from national surveys, whereas differences were found for typical amphetamine-type recreational drugs, particularly MDMA, and for heroin. The WBE data suggest that the largest proportion of morphine came from heroin consumption and that the percentage of heroin users seeking treatment in Split is probably rather low. The prevalence of smoking calculated in this study (30.6\u202f%) was consistent with national survey data for 2015 (27.5-31.5\u202f%), while the average alcohol consumption per capita >15\u202fyears (5.2\u202fL) was lower than sales statistics suggest (8.9\u202fL).",

The present work aims to organise the literature that deals with the association between sleep and substance use in young adults, also considering self-medication behaviours. We adopted a framework that accounts for the multidimensionality of sleep and the effect of different substances. We considered sleep disturbances (insomnia symptoms, sleep quality), sleep health dimensions (duration, satisfaction, efficiency, timing, daytime alertness), circadian characteristics (chronotype). Substances were alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, cannabis, others. We included 46 studies. The use of caffeine and nicotine was associated with higher odds of sleep disturbances. No significant effect was detected for sleep duration. In narrative findings, daytime dysfunction was associated with alcohol and caffeine use, and poor sleep satisfaction with nicotine use. Few evidence were available for the other sleep health dimensions. Evening chronotype was associated with alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine use. Few studies focused on cannabis or self-medication. Longitudinal results were inconclusive. We found a distinct pattern of associations between different substances and different sleep outcomes. Further investigation considering the multidimensionality of sleep would create a better understanding of the complex relationship between substance use and sleep health in young adults.",

The proliferation of legalized cannabis in the US has led to greater access and availability, causing cannabis to become the new \"gateway\" drug. This study examined the prevalence of trying cannabis before alcohol or tobacco and the association of initiation with cannabis first with single and poly-substance use in young adults.\nMETHODS: Data were analyzed from young adults (n=8062) in Waves 1 through 5 (2013-2019) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study who had ever tried alcohol, cannabis, or tobacco and provided age at first use of these substances. Weighted multivariable models examined associations between cannabis initiation before, at the same age, or after initiating alcohol or tobacco use with past 30-day substance use (alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, poly-substance use) in a subsequent wave (Waves 2-5).\nInitiating cannabis before alcohol and tobacco (6%) was rare. In adjusted regression models, initiating cannabis before alcohol and tobacco was associated with increased odds of past 30-day cannabis use, past 30-day tobacco use, and past 30-day polysubstance use and decreased odds of past 30-day alcohol use. Initiating cannabis at the same age as either alcohol or tobacco, or trying cannabis after these substances was associated with increased odds of all substance use outcomes.\nCannabis initiation before alcohol and tobacco is uncommon and may even protect against future alcohol use.

This secondary explorative study compared the effectiveness of three antipsychotics in patients with SSD, with and without drug use.\nThe BeSt InTro multi-centre, head to head, rater-blinded randomised study compared amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine over a 1-year follow-up period. All patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0144) were aged \u226518\u00a0years and met the ICD-10 criteria for SSD (F20-29). Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The primary outcome was reduction of a PANSS positive subscale score.\nAt baseline, 38% of all patients reported drug use in the last 6\u00a0months before inclusion, with cannabis as the main drug (85%), followed by amphetamine-type stimulants (45%), sedatives (26%), hallucinogens (19%), cocaine (13%), opiates (4%), GHB (4%), solvents (4%), analgesics (4%) and anabolic steroids (2%). The predominant pattern was the use of several drugs. There were no significant overall differences in the PANSS positive subscale score reduction for the three studied antipsychotics among patients either with or without drug use. In the drug use group, older patients treated with amisulpride showed a greater PANSS positive subscale score reduction during the treatment period compared to younger patients.\nThe current study showed that drug use does not appear to affect the overall effectiveness of amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine in patients with SSD. However, amisulpride may be a particularly suitable choice for older patients with drug use.",

Parallel to legislative changes in some jurisdictions regarding herbal cannabis, unregulated and cheap synthetic cannabinoids with astonishing structural diversity have emerged. Recently, semi-synthetic cannabinoids manufactured from hemp extracts by simple chemical transformations have also appeared as recreational drugs. The burst of these semi-synthetic cannabinoids into the market was sparked by legislative changes in the United States, where cultivation of industrial hemp restarted. By now, hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD), initially a blockbuster product on its own, became a \"precursor\" to semi-synthetic cannabinoids such as hexahydrocannabinol (HHC), which appeared on the drug market in 2021. The synthesis and cannabimimetic activity of HHC were first reported eight decades ago in quest for the psychoactive principles of marijuana and hashish.

Sample size and research methodology that was used in prior studies may have resulted in the conflict. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of cannabis use on outcomes in trauma patients using national data. Our hypothesis was that the use of cannabis will impact outcomes.\nThe trauma quality improvement program (TQIP) Participant Use File (PUF) database of the calendar years 2017 and 2018 were accessed for the study. All trauma patients aged 12 years old and above who were tested for cannabis at the time of initial evaluation were included in the study. Variables included in the study were: race, sex, injury severity score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Score, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of different body regions and comorbidities. Excluded from the study were all patients who were not tested for cannabis or tested for cannabis but were also tested positive for alcohol and other drugs and those suffering from mental conditions. Propensity matched analysis was performed. The outcome of interest was overall in-hospital mortality and complications.\nPropensity matched analysis created 28,028 pairs. The analysis showed no significant difference in-hospital mortality between cannabis positive and cannabis negative groups (3.2%\u00a0vs. 3.2%). The median length of hospital stay in both groups was not significantly different (4 [IQR: 3-8] vs. 4 [IQR: 2-8] days). No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding hospital complications except in pulmonary embolism (PE) with 0.1% less incidence of PE in the cannabis positive group compared to the cannabis negative group (0.4\u00a0vs. 0.5%). The incidence of DVT was identical in both groups (0.9%\u00a0vs. 0.9%).\nCannabis was not associated with overall in-hospital mortality or morbidity.

We examined links between substance use frequency, and pandemic impact on emotional, physical, economic, and other key domains, using Bayesian Gaussian graphical networks in which edges represent significant associations between variables (referred to as nodes). Bayesian network comparison approaches were used to assess the evidence of stability (or change) in associations between the two timepoints.\nAfter controlling for all other nodes in the network, multiple significant edges connecting substance use nodes and pandemic-experience nodes were observed across both time points, including positive- (r range 0.07-0.23) and negative-associations (r range -0.25 to -0.11). Alcohol was positively associated with social and emotional pandemic impacts and negatively associated with economic impacts. Nicotine was positively associated with economic impact and negatively associated with social impact. Cannabis was positively associated with emotional impact. Network comparison suggested these associations were stable across the two timepoints.\nAlcohol, nicotine, and cannabis use had unique associations to a few specific domains among a broad range of pandemic-related experiences.

However, patients continue to suffer from significant side effects of antineoplastic agents that greatly affect their quality of life (QOL), including chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), and chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA). This review aims to provide an updated overview of emerging strategies for the management and prevention of these immediate and long-lasting side effects. The use of integrative medicine including cannabis continues to evolve in the realm of CINV and cancer-related anorexia. Although no pharmaceutical agent has been approved for the prevention of CIPN, cryotherapy, compression therapy and, more recently, cryocompression therapy have shown benefit in small trials, but there are concerns with tolerability especially related to cryotherapy. More data are necessary to determine an effective and tolerable option to prevent CIPN in large, randomized studies. Scalp cooling (SC), which has a similar mechanism to cryotherapy and compression therapy for CIPN prevention, has proven to be an effective and tolerable approach in randomized studies and has significantly limited CIA, an entity that definitively affects the QOL of patients living with cancer. Taken together, cannabis, cryotherapy, compression and cryocompression therapy, and SC all strive to improve the QOL of patients living with cancer by minimizing the side effects of chemotherapeutic agents.",

Retrospective change is not equivalent to change in repeated self-reported measures giving raise to questions about the validity of the former. This paper purports to investigate inconsistencies between change measures by confronting retrospective change to information from longitudinally self-reported measures from the C-SURF cohort study. The study sample consists of 2,279 young men who participated in C-SURF between 2020 and 2021, and completed between May and June 2021 a survey covering change in alcohol, cigarette, cannabis and other addictive behaviors related to the pandemic. The aforementioned behaviors were assessed longitudinally at two time points using self-reports, and retrospective change since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis was also assessed at the second measurement time. Information from both prospective and retrospective change measures were confronted to identify inconsistent information for each behavior. Additionally, multiple logistic regressions were performed to assess associations between socioeconomic status, impulsivity, depression, and different indicators of motivation to complete the study and inconsistency between both measures for each behavior of interest. Importantly, inconsistent information in at least one of the investigated behaviors was found in about 90% of the participants.

        "abstract": "With legislative changes to cannabis legalization and increasing prevalence of use, cannabis is the most commonly used federally illicit drug in pregnancy. Our study aims to assess the perinatal outcomes associated with prenatal cannabis use disorder.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using California linked hospital discharge-vital statistics data and included singleton, nonanomalous births occurring between 23 and 42 weeks of gestational age. \u03c7 2 Test and multivariable logistic regression were used for statistical analyses.\nA total of 2,380,446 patients were included, and 9144 (0.38%) were identified as using cannabis during pregnancy. There was a significantly increased risk for adverse birthing person outcomes, including gestational hypertension (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.34; P = 0.004), preeclampsia (AOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.0-1.28; P = 0.006), preterm delivery (AOR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.35-1.55; P < 0.001), and severe maternal morbidity (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.47; P = 0.033). Prenatal cannabis use disorder was also associated with an increased risk of neonatal outcomes including respiratory distress syndrome (AOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.27; P < 0.001), small for gestational age (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38-1.56; P < 0.001), neonatal intensive care unit admission (AOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.16-1.33; P < 0.001), and infant death (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.44-2.41; P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in stillbirth (AOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.69-1.34; P = 0.80) and hypoglycemia (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.49; P = 0.045).\nOur study suggests that prenatal cannabis use disorder is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

        "abstract": "Among people with opioid use disorder (OUD), having a co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with lower likelihood of receiving OUD treatment medications (MOUD). However, it is unclear how distinct co-occurring SUDs are associated with MOUD receipt. This study examined associations of distinct co-occurring SUDs with initiation and continuation of MOUD among patients with OUD in the national Veterans Health Administration (VA).\nElectronic health record data were extracted for outpatients with OUD who received care August 1, 2016, to July 31, 2017. Analyses were conducted separately among patients without and with prior-year MOUD receipt to examine initiation and continuation, respectively. SUDs were measured using diagnostic codes; MOUD receipt was measured using prescription fills/clinic visits. Adjusted regression models estimated likelihood of following-year MOUD receipt for patients with each co-occurring SUD relative to those without.\nAmong 23,990 patients without prior-year MOUD receipt, 12% initiated in the following year. Alcohol use disorder (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.90) and cannabis use disorder (aIRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87) were negatively associated with initiation. Among 11,854 patients with prior-year MOUD receipt, 83% continued in the following year.

To identify patterns of prenatal substance use, we conducted latent class analysis. We then calculated the prevalence of depression, anxiety, intimate partner violence, and family drug use history for each prenatal substance use group and compared the prevalences by estimating prevalence ratios using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.\nWe identified the following 4 latent groups with different patterns of substance use: ( a ) predominantly alcohol and no other substances (9.30%), ( b ) predominantly cannabis and no other substances (4.88%), ( c ) predominantly nicotine and some pharmaceutical opioids (1.09%), and ( d ) high-polysubstance (alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, and stimulants; 0.36%); these pregnancies were compared with ( e ) no prenatal substance use (84.37%). The prevalence of all behavioral health conditions was elevated in all prenatal substance use groups compared with the no substance use group. Furthermore, the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders, intimate partner violence and family drug use history were greater in the high-polysubstance cluster than the alcohol and cannabis clusters.\nResults highlight the importance of screening and interventions for all types of substance use during early pregnancy and suggest a particularly high need to prioritize targeting early interventions to pregnant and reproductive age individuals with polysubstance use.",

While numerous studies have examined the impact of RCLs on cannabis use, there is less research on the risk of developing cannabis use disorder (CUD). This review summarizes the latest research on the effects of RCLs on CUD prevalence and cannabis treatment admissions.\nNine studies were published between 2016 - 2022 that examined RCLs and CUD or treatment. Findings generally indicate an increase in CUD prevalence associated with legalization, but effects differ by age group. There was no significant association between legalization and CUD treatment admissions, and CUD admissions decreased overall during the study periods.\nTo improve policy, prevention, and treatment services, policymakers should monitor RCLs' effects on adverse public health outcomes and researchers should consider the effects on individual and community-level characteristics.

This study identified heavy cannabis user groups according to consumption patterns and factors associated with class membership.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study of 380 Spanish residents (61.8% male; average age\u2009=\u200930.3 years) who had used cannabis\u2009\u2265\u20093 days/week throughout the past year. Participants were recruited through chain referral and cannabis social clubs. We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to cluster participants according to use intensity. LCA indicators included frequency of weekly cannabis use, joints smoked each day, cannabis dosage, and if cannabis was consumed throughout the day or only at specific times. Associations between class membership and socio-demographics, use patterns, motives, supply sources, adverse outcomes, and use of other substances were measured using ANOVA and chi-squared tests. Multinomial regression identified the factors associated with latent class membership.\nThree latent classes (moderately heavy: 21.8%, heavy: 68.2%, very heavy: 10%) had average weekly cannabis intakes of 2.4, 5.5, and 18.3\u00a0g, respectively. Very heavy users were older ([Formula: see text]=17.77, p\u2009<\u20090.01), less educated [Formula: see text]=36.80, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and had used cannabis for longer (F\u2009=\u20094.62, p\u2009=\u20090.01). CAST scores (F\u2009=\u200926.51, p\u2009<\u20090.001) increased across the classes. The prevalence of past-month alcohol use was lower among the heaviest users ([Formula: see text]=5.95, p\u2009=\u20090.05). Cannabis was usually obtained from a club by very heavy users ([Formula: see text]=20.95, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nPeople who use cannabis heavily present three groups according to frequency and quantity of cannabis consumption. Use intensity is associated with increased cannabis-related problems. Differences among heavy users must be considered in harm reduction interventions in cannabis clubs and indicated prevention.",

Perceived harms to health of cannabis and tobacco (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, hookah, smokeless tobacco, and secondhand tobacco smoke) were measured from 1-\"Not at all harmful\" to 7-\"Extremely harmful.\" Mixed-effects logistic regressions examined associations between perceived harms and use of tobacco and cannabis, controlling for demographics.\nParticipants perceived lower harm for cannabis than for tobacco products. Perceived harms of e-cigarettes, hookah, and smokeless tobacco significantly increased over time; while perceived harms of cigarettes, secondhand tobacco smoke, and cannabis did not change. Increased perceived harm of e-cigarettes was associated with lower odds of any tobacco use (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.72, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.56, 0.92), and increased perceived harm of cannabis was associated with lower odds of any cannabis use (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.42, 0.62).\nFindings suggest that perceived harms of e-cigarettes and cannabis play important roles in driving young adult use behaviors.
